Custom diagnostics for CESM / CAM model output
This package is built on top of `xarray` which provides the underlying
grid-aware data structures.
The method `open_dataset()` wraps the `xr.open_dataset()` method
and attempts to compute a bunch of useful diagnostics in addition to returning
a handle to the raw model output.
